Project Explanation & description:

ii) I made a chatbot using azure Qna Maker there i created the knowledge base for my bot & then i publish it & after that i link it to azure bot service then using gtoogle sites i create a site for my bot i get the bot embedded code & secret code  and upload it in google sites and that is all i have done and my bot works abosoulutely fine.

iii) Nowadays many people goes to bank to know about some basic things about loan like what's the eligibility criteria? what documents are needed and what is the interest rate and charges?This process is time consuming and the customer has to go to the bank to know about some of these basic things ,bankers also face a lot of problems they have to  explain this  things to their customers because of which other major activities of the bank got stuck,It has a huge impact on the whole banking process.to solve this problem i made a chatbot called 'LoanBuddy' using Azure.With the help of this chatbot  people can easily get answers to their loan related basic questions  from the comfort of their home, so they don't have to go to bank this will save a lot of time,And it is beneficial for both the bank and the customer.
